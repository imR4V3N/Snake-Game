Here is a short description of the project :

1. **Classic snake game** : The project recreates the classic snake game, where the player controls the direction of the snake using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
2. **Swing GUI** : The game's user interface is developed using the Java Swing library, providing an interactive user experience with graphical components such as windows, buttons and panels.
3. **Game Features** : The player can control the snake to make it move across the game space. The snake grows when it eats an apple and the player scores points for each item eaten. The game ends if the snake hits the walls or bites its tail.
4. **Collision handling** : The project implements logic to detect collisions between the snake and walls, as well as collisions between the snake's head and body, which would result in the game ending.

In summary, the "Snake Game" project under Java Swing recreates the classic snake game with a friendly graphical user interface, providing a fun and entertaining gaming experience for players of all ages.
